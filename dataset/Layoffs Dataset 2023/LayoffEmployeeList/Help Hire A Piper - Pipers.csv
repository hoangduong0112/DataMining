"Note: This week at Chili Piper, we've made the difficult decision to reduce the size of our team by 58 Pipers. We’ve always done everything we could to avoid layoffs, and this is the first time we’ve made such a painful decision. Our single focus this week is to support our (brilliant, hardworking) departing Pipers and accompany them in their transition and as a result we've built this sheet for everyone who is hiring to help these incredible Pipers find their next role.
